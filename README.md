# Systems-Analysis-and-Design
The main focus of this course is to provide a practical approach of systems analysis and designing skills for the students. Hence the course enables students to study information system requirements for any system application within an organizational context. The contents are sequentially organized directly from planning, analysis, designing and implementation phases. The course includes some main topics such as steps in conducting systems feasibility studies, information gathering techniques, analysis and design systems tools and model within an organizational context, process-modelling technique using data flow diagram, designing model using structure and behavioural modeling, and prepare the process specification using  structured English or pseudo codes. From the resulting output of the planning and analysis phase shall enable students to form input, output and interface design. Hence a basic system prototype can be developed.



Assignment 1 (Mini Case) [assignment_1.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Systems-Analysis-and-Design/files/7598869/assignment_1.pdf)

The Kinabalu Travel Service (KTS)
Kinabalu Travel Service (KTS) is an online travel service that books semester break trips to resorts for college students. Students have booked semester break trips for decades, but changes in technology have transformed the travel business in recent years. KTS moved away from having campus reps with posted fliers and moved to the Web early on. The basic idea is to get a group of students to book a room at a resort for one of the semester break weeks. KTS contracts with dozens of resorts in key semester break destinations like Sarawak, Brunei, Indonesia, and major cities in Sabah. Its Web site shows information on each resort and includes prices, available rooms, and special features. Students can research and book a room, enter contract information, and pay deposits and final payments through the system. KTS provides updated booking information, resort information updates, and travel information for booked students when they log in to the site.

The resorts also need access to information from KTS. They need to know about their bookings for each week, the room types that are booked, and so forth. Before the semester break booking season starts, they need to enter information on their resorts, including prices and special features. Resorts need to be paid by KTS for the bookings, and they need to be able to report and collect for damages caused by semester breakers during their stay. KTS has recently decided to upgrade its system to provide social networking features for students. It is currently researching possibilities and collecting information from prospective customers about desirable features and functions. From the business standpoint, the idea is to increase bookings by enhancing the experience before, during, and after the trip.

1.    Who are the stakeholders for KTS? For each type of stakeholder, what aspects of the KTS booking system are of particular interest?
2.    What are the main functional requirements for the major subsystems (i.e., resort relations, student booking, accounting and finance, and social networking)?
3.    Describe some usability requirements for students, booking interactions, and social networking interactions.
4.    Assuming that social networking at the resorts will require wireless communication and connection to the Internet, what are some reliability requirements that resorts might 
      be asked to maintain? What are some performance requirements? Is this a bigger issue because some resorts are in international locations?
5.    What are some security requirements? Is there any reason why students in any Asia region, or other locations could not book rooms through KTS? What issues might be 
      anticipated?
6.    To collect information on functional requirements for the social networking subsystem, what are some techniques that might be used?

The Kinabalu Travel Service (KTS)

Question 1:
Kinabalu Travel Service (KTS), introduced in Assignment 1, includes many use cases that make up the functional requirements. Consider the following description of the Booking subsystem. A few weeks before New Year break, it is time to open the system to new bookings. Students usually want to browse through the resorts and do some planning. When a student or group of students wants to book a trip, the system allows it.

Sometimes, a student needs to be added or dropped from the group or a group changes size and needs a different type of room. One month before the actual trip, it is time for the system to send out final payment requirement notices. Students cancel the booking or they pay their final bills. Students often want to look up their booking status and check on resort details. When they arrive at the resort, they need to check in; and when they leave, they need to check out.

1.    Using the event decomposition technique for each event you identify in the description here, name the event, state the type of event, and name the resulting use case. Draw 
      a use case diagram for these use cases.

2.    Consider the new Social Networking subsystem that KTS is researching that was described in Assignment 1. Think in terms of the user goal technique to identify as many use 
      cases as you can think of that you would like to have in the system. KTS is guessing you might want to join, send messages, and so forth, but there must be many 
      interesting and useful things the system could do before, during, and after the trip. Draw a use case diagram for these use cases.



Mini Project (Report) [MINI PROJECT.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Systems-Analysis-and-Design/files/7598885/MINI.PROJECT.pdf)


Think about the The KinabaluTravel Service(KTS) system that your team are going to develop. What you have done so far are including:

1.    Create a use-case diagram for the whole system.
2.    Create a class diagram for the use cases from 1.

So continue your analysis and design phase by:
1.    Write use-case description for each of your system’s use cases.
2.    Create sequence diagrams for the scenarios of the above use cases.
3.    Create communication diagrams for the scenarios of the above use cases.
4.    Create a behavioral state machine for any complex object that you’ve identified (optional).
5.    Perform a CRUDE analysis to show the interactivity of the objects in the system.
6.    Class and method design:
        a. Create the Class Normalization.
        b. Choose one of the methods in the class that you chose and create a contract and a method specification for it. Use OCL to specify any pre- or postcondition and use              Structured English to specify the algorithm.
7.    Database design
8.    User interface design:
        a. Develop two use scenarios for your system
        b. Draw a WND
        c. Create interface design prototyping using a storyboard, Windows layout diagrams, HTML Prototype, or language prototype.
* You may use UML diagramming tools or any other suitable software.
